#M6 Tests
## Sully's Tests
`projectileInstantiates` Tests to see if projectile is instantiates at all. This provides a visual guide to the player to see the tower is attacking.

`rightProjectile` Tests to see if the correct projectile is instaited from the right tower. When there are multiple towers placed, the player can differentiate which tower is attacking which enemy.

## Hannah's Tests
My first test checks to make sure when the final boss dies, the player gets moved to the game won screen. It does this by placing towers to kill the final boss and then checking that the nodes from the winning screen are visible. This is important to test because the player needs to be alerted when they have won the game. 

My second test checks that the total damage dealt counter is updated when the towers deal damage to the enemies. It does this by placing towers and having them shoot at enemies and then checking that the damage dealt variable is not zero. This is important to test because the player needs to be able to see stats about their game play at the end of the game, and these stats should be updated correctly.

## Daniel's Tests
My first test will check that the tower attack does increase properly
My second test will check that you can only upgrade if you have sufficient money

## Jessie's Tests
For my test I tested will the button will still be exist and keep upgrade it after press it once and the second test is to check if the button has the right text
## Tamara's Tests
For my test I will confirm that the final boss (ozai) is dead when itâ€™s health runs out, and another test to ensure that the values for the coin amount, damage, and speed are correct for ozai. This is important because the final boss has different values for the speed, health, damage, and coin amount from the other enemies
